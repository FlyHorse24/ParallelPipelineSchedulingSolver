# ParallelPipelineSchedulingSolver

Parallel Pipeline Scheduling Solver (PPSS) is a parallel pipeline scheduling solver using SMT solvers for efficient optimization of llm pipeline parallel training systems.

## Project Structure

This project mainly contains two modules: simulator and painter.

### Simulator

The simulator module is mainly responsible for the simulation and optimization of parallel pipeline scheduling. It uses SMT solvers for efficient optimization.

### Painter

The painter module is mainly responsible for presenting the output results of the simulator in a graphical form, making it easier for users to understand and analyze.

## Usage

1. Configure the parameters for the simulator and painter.
2. Run the simulator for simulation and optimization of parallel pipeline scheduling.
3. Use the painter to visualize the simulation results.
